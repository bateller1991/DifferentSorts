# DifferentSorts

This is a Java program that allows the user to choose the size of an array and the range of random values that will be filled into it, and then sort it using either bubble sort or merge sort. The time to sort the array is recorded for each algorithm, allowing the user to compare their runtime.

 # Usage
 
1.	Clone the repository to your local machine.

      •	 git clone https://github.com/your-username/DifferentSorts.git 
      
      
2.	Navigate to the DifferentSorts directory.

      •	 cd DifferentSorts 
      
      
3.	Compile the program.

      •	 javac Main.java 
      
      
4.	Run the program.

      •	 java Main 
      

5.	Follow the prompts in the menu to choose the size of the array, the range of random values, and how many elements to print from the unsorted and sorted arrays.

6.	After the array is filled with random values, the user will be brought back to the menu to choose between bubble sort or merge sort.

7.	The time to sort the array using the chosen algorithm will be recorded and displayed to the user.


# Notes

•	For array sizes of 75,000 and higher, the difference in runtime between bubble sort and merge sort should be more noticeable. However, larger array sizes may take longer to sort.

•	This program was tested on Java 11 and should work on most recent versions of Java.

•	This program uses the standard Java library and does not require any additional dependencies.
